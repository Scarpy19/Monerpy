Don't make any changes to the database schema or the Prisma schema file unless I give you permission to do it.

Always maintain the same style of the frontend, including the use of Tailwind CSS classes, and JavaScript for frontend interactivity.

When making changes to the code, ensure that you follow the existing patterns and conventions used in the project. If you are unsure about how to implement a feature or fix a bug, ask for clarification before proceeding.

Feel free to ask whatever and whenever you need to know something to complete the project. if you have any question do it before doing any change.

Always use pnpm to install dependencies and run scripts.
